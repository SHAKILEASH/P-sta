# Písta

Písta is a webcam application which detects motion and records only during the motion.
Písta means track in Greek.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](httpspip.pypa.ioenstable) to Run Písta.

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Records only during the motion thus saving a lot of space and notes the timestamp of motion.

## CRUX
Previous frame and the current frame is compared continuously until the changes are detected when it finds the difference the recording starts from that frame and stops when the motion stops(when there is no difference in the two frames)
